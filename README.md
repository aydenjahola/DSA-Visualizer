# DSA Visualizer

DSA Visualizer is a Java-based application that provides interactive visualizations of various sorting algorithms. Designed to aid in understanding and teaching data structures and algorithms, it offers real-time animations and step-by-step explanations of sorting processes.

## Features

- **Interactive Animations**: Visualize sorting algorithms with engaging, real-time animations.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Explore algorithms such as Bubble Sort, **COMING SOON**: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of animations to match your learning pace.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: View textual descriptions of each step during the sorting process.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:aydenjahola/DSA-Visualizer.git
   cd DSA-Visualizer
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE.
   - Ensure you have [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) configured in your development environment.
   - Build and run the project through the Make file.

## Usage

Upon launching the application:

1. **Select a Sorting Algorithm**: Choose from the available algorithms in the control panel.
2. **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to set the desired animation speed.
3. **Start, Pause, or Reset**: Control the visualization using the provided buttons.
4. **Observe and Learn**: Watch the algorithm sort the array and read the step-by-step explanations displayed.
